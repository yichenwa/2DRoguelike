Official Release

Here you will find the source code for our official release. The file "StuckBetween.zip" contains the executable file for our program.

Download and unzip the file called "Source Code v1.0.0.zip" and open the extracted folder in Unity.
We would have included the zipped folder containing our source code directly on GitHub, but the file was too large to upload.
We do not recommend trying to run our source code off of a cloned version of our GitHub repository.

1. Go to the root directory
2. Download StuckBetween.zip
3. Unzip StuckBetween.zip
